<p><em><strong>my perspective of how i see life</strong></em></p>
<p>Whats the purpose of life? 
recently a started thinking about this old-age question and i got a fascinating new twist where we can blend philosophy, physics, and computer science. recently someone asked me the question what is my purpose in life and i gave him this answer &quot;we really cant tell purpose in non-deterministic, so anything life throws at you shape it for the better in one word purpose is uncertain&quot; and the i later thought about that answer for a while which i ended up in a mind blending exploration of existence itself. </p>
<p><em>my first thought</em> : what if our reality is just a really complex computational simulation? yeah i know this look like a sci-fi movie. but if we really think about it, it&#39;s a concept that forces us to re evaluate everything we think we know. 
*<strong>the certainty of code vs the uncertainty of life</strong> : in a classical computer program, the output is certain. if the code is written correctly it will always produce the same result for the same input, However i said purpose is anything but certain. we constantly change, adapt and redefine our goals. This led to a interesting question, if we live in a simulation would our purpose not be a predictable outcome of the code, making all our choice illusion? this is where the 3 field began to collide. </p>
<p><em><strong>the quantum twist</strong></em> : when programs become unpredictable we challenge the idea that a program result is always certain by introducing quantum computing. unlike classical computers with predictable bits 0s and 1s, a quantum computer uses qubit which can exist in multiple state at once (super position). the result of a process running on a quantum computer is probabilistic and fundamentally uncertain till it measured. this change the game if our simulation is running on a quantum computer then uncertainty in not a bug but rather a feature. the purpose of the program might not be to achieve a specific outcome, but to explore endless possibilities of a truly unpredictable system. our free will and our ever changing purpose could be the very point of the simulation. and for a minute i went blank and the thought of tesla came to my mind. What was his purpose and did he fulfill it? in my perspective i think tesla purpose was to revolutionize the world with electricity and wireless power. he was a pioneer of alternative current, which power our world today. in that sense he absolutely fufilled his purpose, However his great visions such as free global energy via his wardenclyffe failed. so i will say he partially fulfilled his purpose, his life and inventions was not the final destination but the essential bridge that led to an advanced future, the uncertainty of his purpose came from external factor and the limitation of his time .  in plato perspective tesla fully fulfilled his purpose by achieving eudaimonia (human flourishing/better life), but i dont see that as a purpose i see that as a necessity or a part of nature to crave for a better life</p>
<p>*<strong>the ultimate program</strong> : the certainty of death ultimately, all this lead to a final profound realization. We can debate the uncertainty of lifes purpose and the nature of a simulated reality but one thing remain constantly certain which is the expected result of life is death. Thinking of life as a program with a definitive end state reframe everything. it not about the result; it is about the dynamic, chaotic and meaningful process that unfold during the program&#39;s runtime. The certainty of death give meaning to the uncertainty of our purpose. </p>
<p>The purpose of our program isn&#39;t to run for ever, but to create beautiful and complex story before it eventually halts. in the end weather our universe is simulated or not the purpose might be the one we choose to create in the presence of our limited time. The expected result of life is death. This connect directly to the idea of a program certain outcome. if we view life a program then death is one truly certain result </p>
<h2>conclusion</h2>
<p>from a biological perspective, the saying that the result of life is death is a fact. Our bodies are complex, self-organizing systems that eventually fail. The program of our metabolism, cellular repair, and organ function has a definitive end state.</p>
<p>from a philosophical perspective, this certainty gives meaning to the uncertain journey of life. Because the program will eventually halt, the choices we make, the relationships we build, and the purposes we pursue during the runtime become incredibly valuable. The uncertainty of our purpose isn&#39;t a bug; it&#39;s a feature that allows for creativity and meaning to exist before the inevitable end.</p>
<p>from a computer science perspective, if our simulation has an end state of death, then everything we experience joy, sorrow, love, creationâ€”are all just transient processes running on the system before the program terminates. The purpose of the program isn&#39;t the eternal state of the variables, but the dynamic and complex interactions that occur before the end is reached. So, while we can&#39;t definitively say what the purpose of a simulated universe would be, </p>
<p>In one word: the purpose isn&#39;t the destination, but the journey. The certainty of death makes the uncertainty of life&#39;s purpose an incredible opportunity, not a flaw. The expected result is to eventually halt, and the unexpected result is the beautiful, chaotic, and meaningful story that unfolds along the way.
so make your journey valuable to the existent of contributing the human advancement </p>
