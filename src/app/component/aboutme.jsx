  My name is Timothy, a self-taught programmer and a physics undergraduate with a strong foundation in web development.

  I'm 18 years old and have been fascinated by computers and how they work since I was 7. I'm currently expanding my expertise in system programming and exploring new technologies.

  I enjoy reading AI/ML research papers to stay informed about the field, though I have not yet implemented them in projects. Currently, I focus on writing code in Zig and JavaScript.
